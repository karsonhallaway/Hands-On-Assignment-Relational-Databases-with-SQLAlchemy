# HOA: Relational Databases with SQLAlchemy

## Objective

Practice creating and managing a relational database using Python and SQLAlchemy. You will define tables, set up relationships, and perform basic CRUD operations.

## Instructions

- [ ] Use Python and SQLAlchemy to complete this assignment.
- [ ] Make sure you have SQLAlchemy installed (`pip install SQLAlchemy`).
- [ ] Use SQLite for simplicity (`sqlite:///example.db`).
- [ ] Submit your Python script (`.py`) with all the steps completed.

## Part 1: Setup

Import necessary modules from SQLAlchemy:

```python
from sqlalchemy import create_engine, Column, Integer, String, ForeignKey, Boolean
from sqlalchemy.ext.declarative import declarative_base
from sqlalchemy.orm import sessionmaker, relationship
```

Create an engine and base:

```python
engine = create_engine('sqlite:///shop.db')
Base = declarative_base()
Session = sessionmaker(bind=engine)
session = Session()
```

## Part 2: Define Tables

Create a `User` table with:
- [ ] `id` (primary key)
- [ ] `name` (string)
- [ ] `email` (string, unique)

Create a `Product` table with:
- [ ] `id` (primary key)
- [ ] `name` (string)
- [ ] `price` (integer)

Create an `Order` table with:
- [ ] `id` (primary key)
- [ ] `user_id` (foreign key referencing `User.id`)
- [ ] `product_id` (foreign key referencing `Product.id`)
- [ ] `quantity` (integer)

Set up relationships:
- [ ] A `User` can have many `Order`s
- [ ] A `Product` can appear in many `Order`s

Hint: Use `relationship()` in the tables to define these connections.

## Part 3: Create Tables

Use `Base.metadata.create_all(engine)` to create the tables in the SQLite database.

## Part 4: Insert Data

- [ ] Add at least 2 users, 3 products, and 4 orders with different quantities.
- [ ] Use `session.add()` and `session.commit()` to save data.

## Part 5: Queries

Write Python code to:

- [ ] Retrieve all users and print their information.
- [ ] Retrieve all products and print their name and price.
- [ ] Retrieve all orders, showing the user's name, product name, and quantity.
- [ ] Update a product's price.
- [ ] Delete a user by ID.

## Part 6: Bonus (Optional)

- [ ] Add a `status` column to the `Order` table (Boolean to represent shipped or not).
- [ ] Query all orders that are not shipped.
- [ ] Count the total number of orders per user.
